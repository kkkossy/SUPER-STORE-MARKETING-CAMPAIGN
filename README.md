## PREDICTION OF CUSTOMER RESPONSE ON MARKETING CAMPAIGN USING ML MODELS

In this notebook, We will be building a model to predict the likelihood of a customer to give a positive response to purchase the Gold membership discount offer and also to identify the different factors which affect the customer's response. This prediction will enable the Superstore Marketing campaign to save cost and time on telephone engagement for the right set of customers.
